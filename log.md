# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started my portfolio project and I started on a book object with CSS.

**Thoughts** Although I have quite a good experience, tinkling with CSS to build something is different always feels challenging and rewarding. Also, I struggled a bit on the design conceptualizing part for my portfolio, but I believe I will figure out on the way.
