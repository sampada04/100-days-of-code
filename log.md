# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 27, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started my portfolio project and I started on a book object with CSS.

**Thoughts** Although I have quite a good experience, tinkling with CSS to build something is different always feels challenging and rewarding. Also, I struggled a bit on the design conceptualizing part for my portfolio, but I believe I will figure out on the way.

### Day 2: February 28, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about CSS svg stroke animation and 3D animation in CSS with rotated3D, backface-visibility. I also used the library react-spring.

**Thoughts** Getting the svg animation done felt really good, I just missed some properties and spent my time on them more than required. Learning about backface visibility was also new, huh I didn't know that moment. Worked with React Spring, planning to work on it more.
