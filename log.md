# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: February 26, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: I started my portfolio project and I started on a book object with CSS.

**Thoughts** Although I have quite a good experience, tinkling with CSS to build something is different always feels challenging and rewarding. Also, I struggled a bit on the design conceptualizing part for my portfolio, but I believe I will figure out on the way.

### Day 2: February 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about CSS svg stroke animation and 3D animation in CSS with rotated3D, backface-visibility. I also used the library react-spring.

**Thoughts** Getting the svg animation done felt really good, I just missed some properties and spent my time on them more than required. Learning about backface visibility was also new, huh I didn't know that moment. Worked with React Spring, planning to work on it more.

## Day 3: February 28, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: I learned about CSS svg path animation and made a plane animation moving on a path and also console text animation

**Thoughts** Relatively worked less today and with CSS animation it seems like even a small change requires quite a lot of time from me.

## Day 4: March 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I used Facebuilder in Blender and MIxamo to create a 3D cartoon model of myself. Then I used React Threee Fiber to display it in canvas.

**Thoughts** I am impressed that I could do this. ALthought its not perfect but using available tools to achieve what I want is awesome. It made me feel that I would be able to do anything just with a little patience, a lot of hardwork and leraning about new things.

## Day 4: March 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: I refined my 3D model a bit and then worked with displaying in react three fiber. I tried different controllers in React Three Drei. 

**Thoughts** At first the presets of React fiber drei seemed easy and cool and now when I want to change the default position scale etc, the presets are becoming frustrating.
